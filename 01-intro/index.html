	   <p>My goals for the semester are to become more fluent in HTML, CSS and Javascript so that my web designs are more accurate and stronger. I'd like to feel comfortable with web development so that I can help my design team in smarter way and feel more knowledgable across multiple platforms.</p>
	   <p>I'm beginning to enjoy web development, however I have always been hesitant and more interested in design. I've realized lately that knowledge of how digital media is created and functions is an important key to my design ability and will help me in the long run. Even though I hear great things about what may come of InDesign and CSS.</p>
